# Ship — Test, Doc, Commit & Push

One command to ship changes: test, lint, CI safety, docs check, commit, push.

**STOP on any failure** — do not continue to the next phase if the current one fails.

## Phase 1: Write/Update Tests

Before running the test suite, check that tests cover the current changes:

1. Run `git diff --name-only` to see changed source files
2. For each changed file in `src/`, check if corresponding tests exist in `tests/`
3. If tests are missing or outdated for the changes, **write or update them first**
4. Every new feature, bug fix, or refactor MUST have test coverage

## Phase 2: Run Test Suite

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && pytest --tb=short
```

If tests fail, STOP and report which tests failed. Do NOT continue.

## Phase 3: Lint & Format

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff check src/ tests/
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

If lint or format fails, fix automatically (`ruff check --fix`, `ruff format`) and re-run. If unfixable, STOP.

## Phase 4: CI Safety Checks

**CRITICAL** — These checks prevent local-passes-but-CI-fails scenarios.
Run these as a subagent in parallel with Phase 3 if possible.

### 4a. Untracked Source Files

```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard src/
```

If any untracked `.py` files exist under `src/`, check whether they are imported
anywhere in tracked files. If imported, they MUST be staged — otherwise CI will
fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### 4b. Cross-Version Lint (Python 3.12 target)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && ruff check --target-version py312 src/ tests/
```

CI runs Python 3.12. When `from __future__ import annotations` is active, imports
used **only in type annotations** become unused at runtime and ruff 3.12 flags them
as F401. Add `# noqa: F401` to those imports or use a `TYPE_CHECKING` guard.

### 4c. Import Integrity

For every file in `git diff --cached --name-only` that has new `import` or `from ... import` lines,
verify the imported module exists in the repo:

```bash
# Example: if file imports agent_orchestrator.core.foo, check:
git ls-files src/agent_orchestrator/core/foo.py
```

If the imported module is not tracked, STOP and report.

## Phase 5: Documentation Sync

Check that docs are in sync with code changes:

1. Read `git diff --name-only` to see changed files
2. If any source files in `src/` changed, check that relevant docs (CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/) reflect the changes
3. If docs need updating, update them before committing

## Phase 6: Commit

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to review changes
2. Stage all relevant files (NOT .env or credentials)
3. Write a concise commit message summarizing the changes
4. Commit with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

## Phase 7: Push

```bash
git push
```

## Output Format

After all phases, produce a ship report:

```
SHIP REPORT
===========
Tests:    [PASS/FAIL] (X passed, Y warnings)
Lint:     [PASS/FAIL]
Format:   [PASS/FAIL]
CI Safety: [PASS/FAIL] (untracked imports, cross-version lint, import integrity)
Docs:     [SYNCED/UPDATED] (list files if updated)
Commit:   [hash] message
Push:     [OK/FAIL]
```
